    <h1>Theory Questions/Answers</h1>
    <hr/>


    <p><b>1) Explain the main differences between JPQL and SQL, and why one might rather want to use
        JPQL when developing JEE programs.</b></p>
    <p>The main difference lays in that JPQL uses an entity or entities while on the other side normal SQL uses a table structure.
        This makes JPQL easier to read in the context of object-oriented programming, since you use entities rather than tables.
        A big reason to use JPQL is that it can bind parameters for you which is secure for SQL injections.
        Another reason is that JPQL ensures portability across different databases.
    </p>

    <p><b>2) In the context of JPA, explain the main differences between a “pessimistic” and an “optimistic”
        lock, and when one might choose to use one of them instead of the other.</b></p>
    <p>
        <b>Optimistic Lock:</b>
        Optimistic locking relies on that transactions don't conflict often.
        It is handled by the code, and uses versioning without any guarantee.
        The version gets checked in the start of and transaction and at the end. If the version number
        differ an exception is thrown and the transaction is marked for rollback

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Pessimistic Lock:</b>
        Pessimistic locking is made for transactions with a high possibility for conflicts.
        It is handled by the database with a full guarantee.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>Who should be used?</b>
        Who you use depends on what kind of application you have. Optimistic is more lightweight since it is handled
        in code and not in the database, whereas pessimistic is heavier and slower since it is handled by the database.
        So using the pessimistic over optimistic should be based on if it is a high chance of conflict since it
        handles conflicts better. While an application with low chance for conflict should use optimistic.

    <p><b>3) In the context of EJB, explain what “Dependency Injection” is, how it works, and why it is
        useful.</b></p>
    <p>
        The way you normally would find other objects which you have a dependency to would be through JNDI.
        In that way you would initiate your own of that object with the new operator.
        With the dependency injection design pattern, the container injects the dependent objects for you.
        The way it works is that it injects a reference to a resource into an attribute at deployment time.
        It is quite useful since you let the container do most of the work so you can focus on what you need to do.

        <br/><br/>
        You can inject many types of resources but those used in the context of EJB is:
        <br/>
        @EJB and @Inject
    </p>
    <hr/>


    <p><b>4) In the context of EJB, explain the concept of “Proxy class”, how it works, and why it is useful.</b></p>
    <p>
        Proxies are often used when lazily fetching a reference to an entity or something alike.
        The container handles all the EJBs, and adds a lot of futures like pooling for stateless beans.
        So when a client asks for data from an ejb it is given a proxy  of the instance of an ejb.
        It is very useful since the container take care of the proxy calls and provides service for the bean instance
        inside such as pooling for stateless beans and managing a beans life cycle.
    </p>

    <p><b>5) In the context of JSF, explain the differences and relation between the XHTML files in the
        “webapp” folder and the actual HTML files rendered on the browser when one accesses those files
        via a JSF servlet.</b></p>
    <p>
        XHTML is built upon HTML and is reformulated in XML. XHTML follows therefore a specific schema with a
        graphical representation in the browser. JSF is a backend technology used, and a JSF page is an XHTML file pretty much.
        When a client asks for an jsf site the server will render the jsf site in HTML before it gets sent back to the browser.

    </p>

    <p><b>6) In a Maven project, explain the steps required to configure automated testing with Selenium, as
        done in class (eg., what needs to be configured, which Maven phases are involved, why the tests
        have to be written as integration instead of unit tests, how to automatically get and install a JEE
        container, etc).</b></p>
    <p>
        There are a few steps you need to go through to get Maven up and running with automatic testing
        through selenium. The most important dependency you need is wildfly which is the container for the database.
        Here are the steps you need to go through:

        <br/>
        <ol>
            <li>You need a selenium dependency in your pom file.</li>
            <li>
                You need to specify when the tests should run in the maven-failsafe-plugin plugin like this:<br/>
                &lt;execution>
                &lt;id>run-tests&lt;/id>
                &lt;phase>integration-test&lt;/phase>
                &lt;goals>
                &lt;goal>integration-test&lt;/goal>
                &lt;goal>verify&lt;/goal>
                &lt;/goals>
                &lt;/execution>
                <br/>Here you specify that you should run integration tests during the "verify" life cycle method.
            </li>
            <li>
                You need to specify that maven should automatically download and unpack the container (wildfly),
                this is done in the maven-dependency-plugin plugin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Last you need the wildfly-maven-plugin. Here you configure user for container. Then under executions
                you must tell the container when it should deploy and undeploy. Which in this case is pre-integration-test
                and post-integration-test
            </li>
            <li>
                After setting these plugins and dependency up your integrations test will run when the
                maven lifecycle verify is run
            </li>
        </ol>

        All these steps can be seen here in my exam application also.

    <p><b>BONUS) E13: JavaAgent - Do explain what “it is actually doing”, eg why that string in the java-opts
        tag has to be written that way.</b></p>
    <p>
        The java-opts string is there to attach the jacoco java agent to the server when tests are run.
        JavaAgent is passed as an argument in the JVM when running the given application.
        Then when the server is shutdown jacoco gets the coverage data in the target folder.
        The string is just the file path to the executable jacoco file and where it should output.
        It uses a lot of auto generated parts so it keeps it self universal for different systems.

        <br/><br/>
        Here is an example of the string without most auto-generated values to show the file path it uses:
        <br/>
        -javaagent:C:\Users\user\.m2\repository\org\jacoco\org.jacoco.agent\0.7.7.2016\org.jacoco.agent-0.7.7.2016-runtime.jar=destfile=${basedir}\target\jacoco-it.exec
        <br/><br/>
        First it says the file path to the jacoco agent on the pc, then it says its "=destfile=" which is where the output
        file for execution data should end up. Here the output ends up in the target folder for each module which uses it.
        This is because it uses ${basedir} which get the basedir for the module it's in.
    </p>
